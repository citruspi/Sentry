## Sentry - Papertrail Alerts via SMS

### Introduction

Sentry accepts Papertrail events (posted via the Webhook alerts) and sends them as SMS messages to your phone via Twilio.

There are numerous uses for this:

- get an SMS whenever someone uses root to log into SSH
- get an SMS whenever your web application crashes
- get an SMS whenever Nginx or another service goes down
- etc.

You can pretty much adapt this to any situation.

### Why?

I recently got hooked on Papertrail. I love their search alerts - you can get an alert whenever a certain string of text shows up in the logs. They had several options for sending you alerts: 

- email
- webhook
- campfire
- etc.

But, no SMS. Sentry fixes that.

### Configuration

#### Sentry Side:

Install `flask` and `twilio`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Change the Twilio Settings in `app.py`:

    account_sid  = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    auth_token   = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    phone_number = "+1XXXXXXXXXX"
    from_number  = "+1XXXXXXXXXX" 

Run it:

    python app.py

If you want to run it on Heroku (as I did), just add the `Procfile` and push it to Heroku.

#### Papertrail Side:

The first step is to setup an alert - [there's a tutorial here](http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/how-it-works/alerts).

Then, set the Webhook for the alert to [domain.com/sentry](), the URL for the Sentry app. I would suggest settings the Frequency to Every Minute so that you get alerts as fast as possible.
