{"name":"Sentry","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nSentry accepts Papertrail events (posted via the Webhook alerts) and sends them as SMS messages to your phone via Twilio.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous uses for this:\r\n\r\n- get an SMS whenever someone uses root to log into SSH\r\n- get an SMS whenever your web application crashes\r\n- get an SMS whenver Nginx or another service goes down\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nYou can pretty much adapt this to any situation.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI recently got hooked on Papertrail. I love their search alerts - you can get an alert whenever a certain string of text shows up in the logs. They had several options for sending you alerts: \r\n\r\n- email\r\n- webhook\r\n- campfire\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nBut, no SMS. Sentry fixes that.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n#### Sentry Side:\r\n\r\nInstall `flask` and `twilio`:\r\n\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nChange the Twilio Settings in `app.py`:\r\n\r\n    account_sid  = \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    auth_token   = \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    phone_number = \"+1XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    from_number  = \"+1XXXXXXXXXX\" \r\n\r\nRun it:\r\n\r\n    python app.py\r\n\r\nIf you want to run it on Heroku (as I did), just add the `Procfile` and push it to Heroku.\r\n\r\n#### Papertrail Side:\r\n\r\nThe first step is to set up an alert - [there's a tutorial here](http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/how-it-works/alerts).\r\n\r\nThen, set the Webhook for the alert to [domain.com/sentry](), the URL for the Sentry app. I would suggest settings the `Frequency` to `Every Minute` so that you get alerts as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nZinc is open source and is distributed under the MIT License:\r\n\r\n\tCopyright Â© 2012 Mihir Singh <me@mihirsingh.com>\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of \r\n\tthis software and associated documentation files (the â€œSoftwareâ€), to deal in \r\n\tthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to \r\n\tuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of \r\n\tthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do \r\n\tso, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \r\n\tcopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED â€œAS ISâ€, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY \r\n\tKIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE \r\n\tWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \r\n\tPURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
