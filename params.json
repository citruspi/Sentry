{"name":"Sentry","tagline":"Papertrail Alerts via SMS","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nSentry accepts Papertrail events (posted via the Webhook alerts) and sends them as SMS messages to your phone via Twilio.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous uses for this:\r\n\r\n- get an SMS whenever someone uses root to log into SSH\r\n- get an SMS whenever your web application crashes\r\n- get an SMS whenever Nginx or another service goes down\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nYou can pretty much adapt this to any situation.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI recently got hooked on Papertrail. I love their search alerts - you can get an alert whenever a certain string of text shows up in the logs. They had several options for sending you alerts: \r\n\r\n- email\r\n- webhook\r\n- campfire\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nBut, no SMS. Sentry fixes that.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n#### Sentry Side:\r\n\r\nInstall `flask` and `twilio`:\r\n\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nChange the Twilio Settings in `app.py`:\r\n\r\n    account_sid  = \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    auth_token   = \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    phone_number = \"+1XXXXXXXXXX\"\r\n    from_number  = \"+1XXXXXXXXXX\" \r\n\r\nRun it:\r\n\r\n    python app.py\r\n\r\nIf you want to run it on Heroku (as I did), just add the `Procfile` and push it to Heroku.\r\n\r\n#### Papertrail Side:\r\n\r\nThe first step is to setup an alert - [there's a tutorial here](http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/how-it-works/alerts).\r\n\r\nThen, set the Webhook for the alert to [domain.com/sentry](), the URL for the Sentry app. I would suggest settings the Frequency to Every Minute so that you get alerts as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nZinc is open source and is distributed under the MIT License:\r\n\r\n\tCopyright Â© 2012 Mihir Singh <me@mihirsingh.com>\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of \r\n\tthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in \r\n\tthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to \r\n\tuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of \r\n\tthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do \r\n\tso, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \r\n\tcopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED â€œAS ISâ€, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY \r\n\tKIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE \r\n\tWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \r\n\tPURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
